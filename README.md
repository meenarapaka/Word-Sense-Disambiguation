# Word-Sense-Disambiguation
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD): This program helps us identify which sense of a word is used in a sentence when a word  has multiple meanings. WSD is an open problem of natural language processing and ontology. 
The main challenge in this program is to create a classifier which identifies the sense of the words (which can be used for
multiple meanings) based on the input file. 
The input files line-train.xml(comprises examples of word line used in sense of phone line and product line) and line-test.xml(comprises sentences that uses word line without any sense being indicated)and generates output file which will contain senses added to text file.
